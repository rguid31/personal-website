# Hi, I'm Ryan Guidry (AKA Ryne | AKA LilRedRiddmHood): Bridging the Gap Between Chemical Engineering and Cutting-Edge Tech

## About Me:

🔬 **Chemical Engineer Turned Tech Enthusiast**:
- My journey began in the hallowed halls of academia, where I delved into the intricacies of chemical engineering. From thermodynamics to reaction kinetics, I reveled in the beauty of molecular dance.
- But my curiosity knew no bounds. I yearned for more—a fusion of science and innovation that transcended traditional boundaries.

🔗 **Blockchain Aficionado**:
- Enter blockchain—the disruptive force that captivated my imagination. I immersed myself in decentralized ledgers, smart contracts, and consensus algorithms. The promise of trust without intermediaries fueled my passion.
- Whether it's Ethereum, Polkadot, or the latest DeFi project, I dissect the code, analyze the protocols, and envision a world reshaped by this technology.

💰 **Crypto Alchemist**:
- Cryptocurrencies aren't just digital coins; they're alchemical concoctions. I've mined, traded, and hodled. I've witnessed bull runs and weathered bear markets.
- But beyond the price charts lies a revolution—an alternative financial system that challenges norms. And I'm here for it.

👨‍💻 **Software Developer Extraordinaire**:
- Ones and zeros are my palette. I've crafted elegant APIs, optimized database queries, and debugged elusive bugs. My code dances to the rhythm of efficiency.
- Whether it's Python, JavaScript, or Solidity, I wield my keyboard like a maestro conducting a symphony of logic.

🌐 **History of the Internet Whisperer**:
- The World Wide Web—the canvas upon which humanity paints its dreams. I trace its lineage from ARPANET to HTTP/3. I marvel at the birth of browsers and the birth pangs of HTML.
- The internet isn't just a tool; it's our collective consciousness. And I've studied its evolution like a historian unearthing ancient scrolls.

🚀 **Web Development Maverick**:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript—the trifecta that powers the digital realm. I've built responsive websites, wrestled with cross-browser compatibility, and breathed life into UI/UX designs.
- Whether it's React, Vue, or a custom CMS, I architect experiences that resonate with users.

## What makes me a diamond in the rough?

- I don't settle for mediocrity. I thrive on complexity, adapt to change, and relish the unknown.
- I'm not just a chemical engineer or a coder—I'm an alchemist weaving disparate elements into digital gold.
- When the next paradigm shift arrives, I won't merely adapt; I'll lead the charge.

So, dear reader, let's embark on this adventure together. Buckle up—we're about to rewrite the rules. 🌟
